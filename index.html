            <h4 style="color: rgb(13, 163, 13); font-size: 24px; text-align: center;">Senior Men</h4>
            <p>
               Aodh Ruadh got their league campaign off to the perfect start with a hard fought win over Kilcar in Páirc Aoidh Ruaidh on Sunday afternoon. 
               There were mild spring conditions and a good crowd in Munday's for the game. True to form, both sides played on the counter and that made for low 
               scoring fare. The Ernesiders had the better of it in a nip and tuck first half. Kilcar pointed straight from the throw-in, but five minutes later Matt Gillespie 
               opened his side's scoring with a sliced, low-trajectory effort. Gillespie then showed good awareness to bat the long ball in down for Shane Delahunty to pop over.
                That ninth minute score put Ballyshannon into a lead they never really looked like relinquishing. Diarmaid McInerney hit two cracking points from play in the 11th and 16th minutes,
                 before Kilcar registered for the first time in 24 minutes to make it 0-4 to 0-2. That's how the scores stayed up to the interval, in a game where the massed defences were very much on top. 
                 In the second half Darren Drummond bulled through to pump over the opening score three minutes in, but that was rapidly followed by two points for the visitors as they enjoyed one of their best spells of the game. 
                 Once again it was Diarmaid McInerney who took command as he connected with a beautiful shot to raise the white flag. Michael McKenna registered a minute later as Aodh Ruadh stretched their lead out to a goal for the
                  first time. Kilcar and Nathan Boyle swapped scores before a foul on Darren Drummond gave McInerney the opportunity to point his first free of the day with six minutes remaining. Kilcar then hit their second purple patch
                   with three points in the last five minutes of normal time taking them back to within a point of the hosts. Nerves were starting to jangle a bit, but Aodh Ruadh settled those in emphatic fashion. David Dolan and Darren Drummond 
                   swept like wrecking balls through the Kilcar defence to create an easy palm in for senior debutante Jack Gallagher. The 1-9 to 0-8 result was probably a fair reflection on exchanges, and the two league points were merited for the 
                   Erne men. Darren Drummond was immense in the final third, while the Dolan axis in midfield were outstanding, particularly when the game was in the melting pot. Minor debutantes Eoghan Kelly, Shane Delahunty and Jack Gallagher all 
                   put in great shifts, while the more mature maestro Diarmaid McInerney continues to thrill with his spectacular shootting. The Aodh Ruadh team and scorers were as follows: Peter Boyle; Callum O'Halloran, Eamonn McGrath, Eoghan Kelly;
                    Michael McKenna (0-1), Darren Drummond (0-1), Niall Murray; David Dolan, Cian Dolan; Diarmuid McInerney (0-4, 1f), Shane Delahunty (0-1), Jack Gallagher (1-0); Eddie Lynch, Nathan Boyle (0-1), Matt Gillespie (0-1). Subs: Colm Kelly for 
                    Shane Delahunty 48 minutes.

            <p>
                The Senior Development squad put in a battling performance in the curtain raiser down in Cloughaneely to come away with the two points. Conditions were tricky and Aodh Ruadh could have
                 been out of sight in the opening exchanges. They were playing with the breeze, but the final pass just deserted the Ballyshannon lads in front of goal with two glorious goal chances being passed up.
                  Aodh Ruadh had the better of the first half without really managing to put the Gaeltacht men away and led 0-6 to 0-3 at the break. Aodh Ruadh were hit with a sucker punch in the opening seconds of 
                  the second half with a dangerous high ball bouncing awkwardly allowing Paul Sweeney to fire home to level proceedings. Cloich Cheann Fhaola then turned over the resulting kick-outs to put two between 
                  the sides. Aodh Ruadh never faltered though with Gary Carty, Aidan Sweeny, Michael Ward and Colm McGloin driving forward from the back and creating scores for Sticky Ward and Robbie Murphy, while 
                  Damian Weber was a constant threat in the Erneside attack. Gary Carty got on the end of a fine move to palm home to restore Aodh Ruadh’s lead. However, Cloich Cheann Fhaola were pushing hard with the
                   backing of the breeze and the evergreen Sean Maguire to the fore. As they chased a levelling score they were caught on the counter and the visitors fed Damian Weber to score a sublime goal with a deft 
                   finish to the bottom of the net as the tie finished 2-12 to 1-10. For Aodh Ruadh, Gary Carty and Michael Ward set the platform for the win with strong running from the back line. Aidan Sweeny on his adult
                    debut was a classy operator at wing back. Credit also to Damian Weber finishing with 1-5 on a day where conditions were tough for forwards. The Aodh Ruadh team and scorers were as follows: Aaron Cullen; 
                    Conor Foy, Michael Ward, Gary Carty (1-0); Darragh Flood Dolan (0-1), Dan Warnock, Aidan Sweeny; Tiernan Flood Dolan (0-1), Colm McGloin (0-1); Senan Rooney, Damian Weber (1-5), Oisin Kerr; Harry Howarth,
                     Sticky Ward (0-2), Robbie Murphy (0-2).
